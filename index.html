        <h2>About AES & DES</h2>
        <p><b>AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)</b> is a symmetric encryption algorithm widely used across the globe. It encrypts data in fixed blocks of 128 bits using 128, 192, or 256-bit keys, making it highly secure and efficient.</p>
        <p><b>DES (Data Encryption Standard)</b> is an older symmetric encryption method. It uses a 56-bit key and operates on 64-bit blocks. Although less secure today, it is important historically and as a basis for understanding encryption methods.</p>
        <p>This website demonstrates encryption and decryption using AES and DES. Navigate to the <b>Encryption Page</b> to try it yourself!</p>
